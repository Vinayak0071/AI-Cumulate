# AI-Cumulate

---

  AI Cumulate is an interactive AI web app built using streamlit and basic python libraries.
- AI Cumulate greatly simplifies the process of writing ML Code
- For example if a user wants to make analysis or predictions on a dataset, all he has to do is upload the dataset, select his preferred algorithm of choice along with the respective parameters and the code at the backend would give the user the appropriate result along with the accuracy of the model.
- This greatly simplifies the entire process of making predictions feasibly without having to write any actual code.
- In addition to this there is a Covid 19 visualisation statistic which depicts the no. of cases in different countries around the world as a function of time.
- The applications of this app can range from clients showcasing their model and observations to investors or just helping our friends understand the usage of Machine Learning models without displaying the laborious code at the backend
- Tech Stack
- Streamlit Web Framework
- Python Libraries and SkLearn Datasets
- PlotLy library for the Covid Statistic
